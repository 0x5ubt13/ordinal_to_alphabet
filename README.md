# Ordinal to alphabet (A1Z26) parser
Simple python converter to decode ordinal numbers 1..26 to ASCII whilst accepting non-numerical characters (flag delimiters, separators, etc.)

# Goal of the project
Are you solving a CTF problem and you find a A1Z26 code but you don't want to go and find a tool in your favourite browser? 

Your solution is here: just call this program and chuck that weird string of numbers and symbols in here, we'll convert it for you!

# Collaborating
Note as of 01/10/2020:
Please feel free to collaborate to this project. It was created as my first ever program for learning purposes and I'm still in school.
I'm willing to revisit the code to check how my knowledge is evolving.

Please also document your changes, so I can learn from the mistakes I've made / new things I didn't know I could do.

Thank you!
Best wishes,
